# ðŸš€ Running Tauri Dev on Windows

## Quick Start Command:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run tauri dev
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. First Time Setup (if not done already):
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Rust (if not installed)
# Download from: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
```

### 2. Start the Backend (in a separate terminal):
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the Python backend
python start_backend_full.py
```

### 3. Run Tauri Dev Mode:
```bash
# Terminal 2 - Start Tauri development
cd frontend
npm run tauri dev
```

## Alternative Commands:

### If `npm run tauri dev` doesn't work:
```bash
# Direct Tauri command
cd frontend
npx tauri dev

# Or with Cargo
cd frontend/src-tauri
cargo tauri dev
```

### Just Frontend (without Tauri shell):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Opens in browser at http://localhost:1420
```

## Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue: "tauri is not recognized"
```bash
# Install Tauri CLI
npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli
```

### Issue: Backend connection refused
```bash
# Make sure backend is running on port 8000
python start_backend_full.py
```

### Issue: Missing dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
