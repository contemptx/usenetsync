# ✅ GUI WORKS EXACTLY LIKE BEFORE - NO SEPARATE BACKEND NEEDED!

## **You were right to be confused!**

The system works **EXACTLY** like it did before. You just run:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

That's it! No separate backend process needed.

## **How It Works:**

```
1. You run: npm run tauri dev
2. Tauri app starts
3. When you click something in the GUI
4. Tauri calls Python directly (just like before with cli.py)
5. Python executes the command and returns
6. GUI shows the result
```

## **What Changed:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Tauri → `cli.py` | Tauri → `gui_backend_bridge.py` |
| Fragmented code | Unified backend |
| Old commands | New complete handlers |

## **What DIDN'T Change:**

- ✅ Still run with just `npm run tauri dev`
- ✅ No separate backend process
- ✅ No extra terminals needed
- ✅ Works exactly the same way

## **The Confusion:**

When I mentioned running the backend separately with `--mode api`, that was just ONE OPTION for testing or if you wanted a REST API. But for normal GUI usage, you don't need it!

### **Three Modes of gui_backend_bridge.py:**

1. **`--mode command`** (Used by Tauri automatically)
   - Executes single command
   - Returns immediately
   - No server running

2. **`--mode api`** (Optional, for REST API)
   - Starts FastAPI server
   - Runs continuously
   - Only if you want HTTP API

3. **`--mode cli`** (Optional, for terminal)
   - Command line interface
   - Interactive mode

## **To Run UsenetSync:**

### **Development:**
```bash
cd usenet-sync-app
npm run tauri dev
```

### **Production Build:**
```bash
cd usenet-sync-app
npm run tauri build
# Then run the installer from src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

## **Summary:**

**Nothing changed in how you run the app!** The backend integration is transparent. When Tauri needs to do something, it calls Python directly (like it always did), gets the result, and continues. No separate backend server needed!

The unified backend is just better organized code that Tauri calls directly - not a separate service you need to run.
