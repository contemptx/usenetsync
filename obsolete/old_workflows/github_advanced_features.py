        # Usenet Fundamentals
        usenet_guide = """# Understanding Usenet

Usenet is a worldwide distributed discussion system that has been running since 1980. UsenetSync leverages Usenet's robust infrastructure for secure file sharing.

## 🌐 What is Usenet?

Usenet consists of:
- **Newsgroups**: Topic-based discussion areas
- **Articles**: Individual posts or files
- **NNTP Servers**: Servers that store and distribute content
- **Binary Groups**: Newsgroups dedicated to file sharing

## 📊 How UsenetSync Uses Usenet

UsenetSync uses Usenet's binary groups to:

1. **Segment Files**: Large files are split into smaller segments
2. **Post Segments**: Each segment is posted as a separate article
3. **Create Index**: An encrypted index tracks all segments
4. **Share Access**: Users share encrypted access strings
5. **Download**: Recipients use the index to reconstruct files

## 🔒 Security Benefits

- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- **Encrypted**: All content is encrypted before posting
- **Anonymous**: No direct peer-to-peer connections
- **Durable**: Content persists on thousands of servers

## 🚀 Performance Advantages

- **Global CDN**: Usenet servers worldwide provide fast access
- **Parallel Downloads**: Multiple segments downloaded simultaneously  
- **High Throughput**: Dedicated connections achieve maximum speeds
- **Reliable**: Built-in redundancy and error correction

## 📋 Best Practices

### Newsgroup Selection
- Use appropriate newsgroups for content type
- Respect newsgroup charters and guidelines
- Use test groups for testing only

### Posting Etiquette
- Don't flood newsgroups with excessive posts
- Use descriptive subject lines
- Follow retention policies

### Security Considerations
- Always use encryption for sensitive content
- Regularly rotate encryption keys
- Monitor for unauthorized access

- **Process**: RFC (Request for Comments) → Discussion → Decision
- **Timeline**: Minimum 1 week discussion period

### Security Decisions
- Security fixes, vulnerability responses, security policy changes
- **Process**: Private discussion → Implementation → Disclosure
- **Authority**: Security team and maintainers only

## 📋 RFC Process

For major changes:

1. **Create RFC**: Use RFC template in discussions
2. **Community Input**: Open discussion period (1-4 weeks)
3. **Revision**: Incorporate feedback and update proposal
4. **Decision**: Maintainers make final decision
5. **Implementation**: Approved RFCs move to development

## 🔒 Security Governance

### Security Team
- **Members**: Maintainers + invited security experts
- **Responsibilities**: Vulnerability assessment, security policy, incident response

### Vulnerability Process
1. **Report**: Private disclosure to security@usenetsync.dev
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates severity and impact
3. **Fix**: Develop and test fix in private
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix is available

## 🤝 Code of Conduct Enforcement

1. **Community Guidelines**: All participants must follow Code of Conduct
2. **Enforcement**: Graduated response (warning → temporary ban → permanent ban)
3. **Appeals**: Available through community@usenetsync.dev
4. **Transparency**: Public log of enforcement actions (anonymized)

## 📊 Project Health

### Metrics We Track
- Contribution diversity and inclusivity
- Security vulnerability response time
- Community engagement and satisfaction
- Code quality and test coverage

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly: Project health metrics
- Quarterly: Governance effectiveness
- Annually: Strategic direction and goals

## 🔄 Governance Evolution

This governance model may evolve as the project grows:
- Additions require RFC process
- Changes require maintainer consensus
- Major changes require community input

## 📞 Questions?

For governance questions:
- General: GitHub Discussions
- Specific: governance@usenetsync.dev
- Appeals: community@usenetsync.dev
