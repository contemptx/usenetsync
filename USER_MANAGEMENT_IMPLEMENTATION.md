# User Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented the single-user management system for UsenetSync, focusing on displaying the permanent User ID that users can share with folder owners to gain access to private shares.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Tauri Backend Commands (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`)

Added three new commands for user management:

- **`get_user_info`**: Returns the current user's information including User ID, display name, and creation date
- **`initialize_user`**: Creates the one-time permanent User ID (only works once, cannot be regenerated)
- **`is_user_initialized`**: Checks if a user profile exists

### 2. TypeScript API Functions (`src/lib/tauri.ts`)

Added corresponding TypeScript functions:

```typescript
getUserInfo(): Promise<{user_id, display_name, created_at, initialized}>
initializeUser(displayName?: string): Promise<string>
isUserInitialized(): Promise<boolean>
```

### 3. User Profile Page (`src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`)

Created a comprehensive User Profile page that:

- **Displays the User ID** with ability to show/hide full ID (shows first 8 and last 8 chars by default)
- **Copy to clipboard** functionality for easy sharing
- **Security information** explaining the permanent nature of the User ID
- **How it works** section explaining the private share access flow
- **Auto-initialization** prompt if user hasn't been initialized yet

### 4. Navigation Updates

- Added User Profile to the main navigation menu
- Added Folder Management to the navigation (was imported but not in routes)
- Both pages are now accessible from the sidebar

### 5. App Initialization (`src/App.tsx`)

Updated the app startup flow to:
1. Check license status
2. If license is valid, check if user is initialized
3. If not initialized, automatically initialize with default settings
4. This ensures user always has a User ID without manual intervention

## Security Features Confirmed

### User ID Properties
- **One-time generation**: Cannot be regenerated or changed
- **64-character hexadecimal**: Cryptographically secure
- **Non-exportable**: Cannot be backed up or recovered if lost
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Used for private share authentication without revealing the ID

### Existing Access Control UI
You were correct - the Folder Management page already has:
- Radio buttons for Public/Private/Protected access types
- Password field for protected shares
- Max downloads setting

### What's Still Missing
For complete private share functionality, we still need:
- UI to add/remove specific User IDs when creating private shares
- Display of authorized users for existing private shares
- This would be added to the Folder Management access control section

## User Flow

1. **First Launch**: User is automatically initialized with a permanent User ID
2. **View Profile**: User can go to Profile page to see their User ID
3. **Share ID**: User copies their ID and sends it to folder owners
4. **Get Access**: Folder owner adds the User ID to their private share
5. **Download**: User can now access the private share using ZK proof authentication

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Single User System**: As requested, the system only supports one user profile
2. **No Regeneration**: User ID cannot be regenerated for security reasons
3. **Automatic Initialization**: User doesn't need to manually create profile
4. **Partial ID Display**: Shows abbreviated ID by default for security, click to reveal full
5. **Clear Security Warnings**: Profile page clearly explains the permanent nature and security implications

## Integration with Existing Systems

The implementation properly integrates with:
- Existing backend security system (`enhanced_security_system.py`)
- User management module (`user_management.py`)
- Zero-knowledge proof system for authentication
- Folder management and access control

## Next Steps

To complete the private share functionality:
1. Add UI in Folder Management to input User IDs when setting access to "Private"
2. Store and display list of authorized User IDs
3. Connect to backend's existing `create_access_commitment` functionality

The foundation is now in place for the single-user system with permanent, secure User IDs that integrate with the existing zero-knowledge proof authentication system.
