# Integration Status

## Completed
- Backend has full authorized users support
- CLI commands added for user management  
- Tauri commands integrated
- PrivateShareManager UI component created

## Key Point
The system already supports updating access control independently of files - only the core index is re-published with new access commitments when users are added/removed.

## Next Steps
Just need to connect the FolderManagement UI to use the existing backend functionality.
