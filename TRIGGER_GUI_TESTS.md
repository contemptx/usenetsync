## Current Status
‚úÖ **Successfully merged to master**
‚úÖ **GUI Tests workflow is now available (ID: 182935570)**
‚úÖ **Can be triggered on any branch**

## How to Trigger the GUI Tests Workflow

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to Actions tab**: 
   https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions

2. **Find "GUI Tests" in the left sidebar**
   - It should now be visible in the workflows list
   - Click on "GUI Tests"

3. **Click "Run workflow" button** (top right)
   - A dropdown will appear

4. **Configure the run**:
   - Branch: Select `master` (or any branch you want to test)
   - Debug mode: Leave as `false` unless you need detailed logs
   
5. **Click the green "Run workflow" button**

### Method 2: Trigger via Push

Any push to these branches will trigger the workflow:
- `main`
- `develop`
- `feature/**` (any feature branch)

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test trigger" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger GUI tests"
git push origin master
```

### Method 3: Create a Pull Request

Creating a PR to `main` or `develop` will trigger the tests:

```bash
git checkout -b test/gui-workflow
git push origin test/gui-workflow
# Then create PR on GitHub
```

## What Will Happen

### The workflow will run 4 parallel jobs:

```
GUI Tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ubuntu-latest / Node 18.x
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ubuntu-latest / Node 20.x
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ windows-latest / Node 18.x
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ windows-latest / Node 20.x
```

### Each job will:

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Install Node.js
   - Install Rust
   - Install system dependencies
   - Install tauri-driver

2. **Build Application**
   - Build frontend (React)
   - Build Tauri app (Rust)

3. **Run Tests**
   - Launch Tauri application
   - Run comprehensive GUI tests
   - Take screenshots
   - Generate reports

4. **On Failure - AI Triage**
   - Analyze failures
   - Identify patterns
   - Suggest fixes
   - Create issue

5. **On Failure - Autofix**
   - Apply safe fixes
   - Create pull request
   - Re-run tests

## Monitor Progress

### Live Monitoring
- **Actions page**: https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions
- **GUI Tests runs**: https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions/workflows/gui-tests.yml

### Expected Timeline
- 0:00 - Workflow starts
- 2:00 - Dependencies installed
- 5:00 - App built
- 10:00 - Tests complete
- 12:00 - AI triage (if needed)

## First Run Expectations

Since this is the first run, expect:

### Possible Issues:
1. **Missing tauri-driver** - Will be installed automatically
2. **Path issues** - AI will detect and suggest fixes
3. **No baseline screenshots** - Will be created on first run
4. **Timeout issues** - AI will adjust timeouts

### Don't Worry!
The AI system will:
- Detect all issues
- Create detailed report
- Apply automatic fixes where safe
- Create PR with remaining fixes
