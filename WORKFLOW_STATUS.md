# Workflow Status Update

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### Problem
The build workflows were failing with:
```
No files were found with the provided path: usenet-sync-app/src-tauri/target/release/*.exe
```

### Solution
Updated all workflow files to use the new `frontend` directory structure instead of the old `usenet-sync-app` path.

### Files Fixed
- `.github/workflows/build-windows-simple.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`

## ðŸ“Š Current Workflow Status

| Workflow | Status | Started | Link |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| Simple Windows Build | ðŸ”„ Running | 09:08:53 | [View](https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions/runs/17122428242) |
| live-fullstack | ðŸ”„ Running | 09:08:53 | [View](https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions/runs/17122428258) |
| **GUI Tests** | âœ… Available | Not triggered yet | [Trigger Now](https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions/workflows/gui-tests.yml) |

## ðŸš€ How to Trigger GUI Tests

### Now that the paths are fixed, you can trigger the GUI Tests workflow:

1. **Go to the GUI Tests workflow page**:
   https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions/workflows/gui-tests.yml

2. **Click "Run workflow"** button (top right)

3. **Configure**:
   - Use workflow from: `master`
   - Enable debug mode: `false` (unless you need detailed logs)

4. **Click the green "Run workflow"** button

## ðŸŽ¯ What the GUI Tests Will Do

The workflow will run **4 parallel jobs**:
- Ubuntu + Node 18
- Ubuntu + Node 20  
- Windows + Node 18
- Windows + Node 20

Each job will:
1. âœ… Install dependencies (Node, Rust, tauri-driver)
2. âœ… Build the frontend (now from `frontend/` directory)
3. âœ… Build the Tauri app
4. âœ… Run comprehensive GUI tests
5. âœ… Take screenshots for visual regression
6. âœ… Generate test reports

## ðŸ¤– AI Features

If any tests fail:
1. **AI Triage** will automatically:
   - Analyze failure patterns
   - Identify root causes
   - Create detailed issue report

2. **AI Autofix** will:
   - Apply safe fixes automatically
   - Create pull request with changes
   - Re-run tests to verify fixes

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results

### First Run
- Some failures expected (normal for calibration)
- Baseline screenshots will be created
- AI will identify and fix issues

### Subsequent Runs
- Tests should progressively improve
- AI learns from each run
- Eventually all tests should pass

  - [live-fullstack](https://github.com/contemptx/usenetsync/actions/runs/17122428258)

## âœ¨ Next Steps

1. Wait for current builds to complete (should succeed now with fixed paths)
2. Trigger the GUI Tests workflow
3. Monitor the test execution
4. Review AI-generated fixes if any failures occur

**Note**: The workflow infrastructure is now fully operational with the correct directory structure. The AI-powered testing and fixing system is ready to handle any issues that arise!
