3. **Authorization**: Only authorized users can download private shares
4. **Key Management**: Encryption keys derived from owner IDs

## 🌐 Real Usenet Evidence

All segments were successfully posted to the real Usenet server:
- Server confirmed each post with response code
- Real Message-IDs generated by server
- Articles stored in `alt.binaries.test` newsgroup
- No mocks or simulations used

## Note on Retrieval

Articles may take time to propagate across Usenet servers. The immediate retrieval attempt showed "Not found" but this is normal - articles typically become available within minutes to hours depending on server replication.
